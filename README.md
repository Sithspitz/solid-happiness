Tidying up InForm export files, also basic analysis scripts.

Original inception date 06/03/2019

Scripts created as part of the RORgT IHC InForm analysis to tidy up and combine export files into something I can analyse.

Can be used in subsequent analyses to combine and tidy up data from InForm.

Created another script later on (18/03/2019) called 'inform_tidying_script_spatial.R' which is used to give summary data of phenotypes by the spatial distribution.
